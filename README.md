## Application and Dependencies

This project is fairly simple with a four hour time limit. For this reason, I  did not see a reason to use any dependencies. 

The only thing you'll need to do is to create .env file in the repo root and set your api key as REACT_APP_MOVIE_API_KEY variable:

.env
REACT_APP_MOVIE_API_KEY=APIKEYGOESHERE


## Challenges

I spend a majority of my time with the filter and pagination, as well as trying to make some of the functionality in App.js fully component based.

## Design Decisions

I wanted to add as many feautures as I could with my time, so I left most of the "design" to the materialize framework.

## Future Improvements

If I had more time:
- I would have set a fallback image for poster_path's set to null. 
- I would also like to display more of the api like "overview" and truncate that, as well as show the ratings.  
- Played with the layout a bit more
- Added infinant scroll pagination intead of a click or touch to view more
- Done more with mobile
- This list can go on for a while as there is always room for improvement.

## Final Thoughts

I sincerely had a great time interacting with this API and creating something new with some extra features. Reguardless of the coding challenge guidelines, I'm going to make improvements on this for my own sake once this has been checked.
